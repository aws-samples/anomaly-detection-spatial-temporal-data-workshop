	abstract = {Fault management is critical to telecommunication networks. It consists of detecting, diagnosing, isolating and ﬁxing network problems, a task that is time-consuming. A promising approach to improve fault management is to ﬁnd patterns revealing the relationships between network alarms, to then only show the most important alarms to network operators. However, a limitation of current algorithms of this type is that they ignore the network topology. But the network topology is important to understand how alarms propagate on a network. This paper addresses this issue by modeling a real-life telecommunication network as a dynamic attributed graph and then extracting correlation patterns between network alarms called Alarm Correlation Rules. Experiments on a large telecommunication network show that interesting patterns are found that can greatly compress the number of alarms presented to network operators, which can reduce network maintenance costs.},

	abstract = {Large scale telecommunications networks need to be continuously monitored to detect problems and react accordingly to ensure the networks stability. Current monitoring systems are well capable to monitor such large scale installations for simple situations like failing routers, links or abnormal link utilization. However, current systems fail to provide near real-time in-depth root cause analysis for nation scale networks. This is particularly important in cases where the monitoring dashboard is flooded with notifications caused by side-effects of one bigger failure. In our project we develop a processing system capable of providing this root cause analysis in a timely fashion even for large telecommunications networks. To cope with these challenges we defined a specialized processing model for the detection and analysis of complex error situations which is largely based on event stream processing mechanisms. In this paper we discuss the first stage of this process and its initial implementation.},

	abstract = {Alarm root cause analysis is a signiﬁcant component in the day-to-day telecommunication network maintenance, and it is critical for eﬃcient and accurate fault localization and failure recovery. In practice, accurate and self-adjustable alarm root cause analysis is a great challenge due to network complexity and vast amounts of alarms. A popular approach for failure root cause identiﬁcation is to construct a graph with approximate edges, commonly based on either event co-occurrences or conditional independence tests. However, considerable expert knowledge is typically required for edge pruning. We propose a novel data-driven framework for root cause alarm localization, combining both causal inference and network embedding techniques. In this framework, we design a hybrid causal graph learning method (HPCI), which combines Hawkes Process with Conditional Independence tests, as well as propose a novel Causal Propagation-Based Embedding algorithm (CPBE) to infer edge weights. We subsequently discover root cause alarms in a real-time data stream by applying an inﬂuence maximization algorithm on the weighted graph. We evaluate our method on artiﬁcial data and real-world telecom data, showing a signiﬁcant improvement over the best baselines.},

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays an important role in digital transformation of traditional industries towards Industry 4.0. By connecting sensors, instruments and other industry devices to the Internet, IIoT facilitates the data collection, data analysis, and automated control, thereby improving the productivity and efﬁciency of the business as well as the resulting economic beneﬁts. Due to the complex IIoT infrastructure, anomaly detection becomes an important tool to ensure the success of IIoT. Due to the nature of IIoT, graph-level anomaly detection has been a promising means to detect and predict anomalies in many different domains such as transportation, energy and factory, as well as for dynamically evolving networks. This paper provides a useful investigation on graph neural networks (GNN) for anomaly detection in IIoTenabled smart transportation, smart energy and smart factory. In addition to the GNN-empowered anomaly detection solutions on point, contextual, and collective types of anomalies, useful datasets, challenges and open issues for each type of anomalies in the three identiﬁed industry sectors (i.e., smart transportation, smart energy and smart factory) are also provided and discussed, which will be useful for future research in this area. To demonstrate the use of GNN in concrete scenarios, we show three case studies in smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory, respectively.},

In this paper, we present a comparative study of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a neurallyinspired model, and other feedforward and recurrent artificial neural network models on both artificial and real-world sequence prediction algorithms. HTM and long-short term memory (LSTM) give the best prediction accuracy. HTM additionally demonstrates many other features that are desirable for real-world sequence learning, such as fast adaptation to changes in the data stream, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance. These features make HTM an ideal candidate for online sequence learning problems.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs becomes very critical in many different application scenarios, e.g., recommender systems, while it also raises huge challenges due to the high ﬂexible nature of anomaly and lack of sufﬁcient labelled data. It is better to learn the anomaly patterns by considering all possible hints including the structural, content and temporal features, rather than utilizing heuristic rules over the partial features. In this paper, we propose AddGraph, a general end-to-end anomalous edge detection framework using an extended temporal GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) with an attention model, which can capture both long-term patterns and the short-term patterns in dynamic graphs. In order to cope with insufﬁcient explicit labelled data, we employ a selective negative sampling and margin loss in training of AddGraph in a semi-supervised fashion. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and illustrate that AddGraph can outperform the state-of-the-art competitors in anomaly detection signiﬁcantly.},

	abstract = {Detecting anomalies for dynamic graphs has drawn increasing attention due to their wide applications in social networks, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. Recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promising results over shallow methods. However, they fail to address two core challenges of anomaly detection in dynamic graphs: the lack of informative encoding for unattributed nodes and the difﬁculty of learning discriminate knowledge from coupled spatial-temporal dynamic graphs. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel Transformer-based Anomaly Detection framework for DYnamic graphs (TADDY). Our framework constructs a comprehensive node encoding strategy to better represent each node’s structural and temporal roles in an evolving graphs stream. Meanwhile, TADDY captures informative representation from dynamic graphs with coupled spatial-temporal patterns via a dynamic graph transformer model. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed TADDY framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on six real-world datasets.},

Anomaly detection is applied to numerous high-impact applications in areas such as cyber-security, ﬁnance, e-commerce, social network, industrial monitoring, and many more mission-critical tasks. While multiple techniques have been developed in past decades in addressing unstructured collections of multi-dimensional data, graph-structure-aware techniques have recently attracted considerable attention. A number of novel techniques have been developed for anomaly detection by leveraging the graph structure. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs), as a powerful deep-learning-based graph representation technique, has demonstrated superiority in leveraging the graph structure and been used in anomaly detection. In this chapter, we provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the existing works that apply GNNs in anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {Much of the world’s data is streaming, time-series data, where anomalies give significant information in critical situations; examples abound in domains such as finance, IT, security, medical, and energy. Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data. We present these components, and give results and analyses for several open source, commercially-used algorithms. The goal for NAB is to provide a standard, open source framework with which the research community can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data.},

	abstract = {Modeling communication networks to predict performance such as delay and jitter is important for evaluat‑ing and optimizing them. In recent years, neural networks have been used to do this, which may have advantages over existing models, for example from queueing theory. One of these neural networks is RouteNet, which is based on graph neural networks. However, it is based on simpli ied assumptions. One key simpli ication is the restriction to a single scheduling policy, which describes how packets of different lows are prioritized for transmission. In this paper we pro‑pose a solution that supports multiple scheduling policies (Strict Priority, De icit Round Robin, Weighted Fair Queueing) and can handle mixed scheduling policies in a single communication network. Our solution is based on the RouteNet ar‑chitecture as part of the ”Graph Neural Network Challenge”. We achieved a mean absolute percentage error under 1\% with our extended model on the evaluation data set from the challenge. This takes neural‑network‑based delay estimation one step closer to practical use.},

Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of trafﬁc ﬂow, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in trafﬁc domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer parameters. Experiments show that our model STGCN effectively captures comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations through modeling multi-scale trafﬁc networks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world trafﬁc datasets.},

These arise in a broad spectrum of problems ranging from biology and particle physics to social networks and recommendation systems. Despite the plethora of different models for deep learning on graphs, few approaches have been proposed for dealing with graphs that are dynamic in nature (e.g. evolving features or connectivity over time). We present Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs), a generic, efﬁcient framework for deep learning on dynamic graphs represented as sequences of timed events. Thanks to a novel combination of memory modules and graph-based operators, TGNs signiﬁcantly outperform previous approaches while being more computationally efﬁcient. We furthermore show that several previous models for learning on dynamic graphs can be cast as speciﬁc instances of our framework. We perform a detailed ablation study of different components of our framework and devise the best conﬁguration that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several transductive and inductive prediction tasks for dynamic graphs.},

More challengingly, how can we do this in a way that captures complex inter-sensor relationships, and detects and explains anomalies which deviate from these relationships? Recently, deep learning approaches have enabled improvements in anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets; however, existing methods do not explicitly learn the structure of existing relationships between variables, or use them to predict the expected behavior of time series. Our approach combines a structure learning approach with graph neural networks, additionally using attention weights to provide explainability for the detected anomalies. Experiments on two real-world sensor datasets with ground truth anomalies show that our method detects anomalies more accurately than baseline approaches, accurately captures correlations between sensors, and allows users to deduce the root cause of a detected anomaly.},

Their performance is substantially hindered when the users’ observed data is limited at an early stage, which needs to be improved to minimize financial loss. In this work, we propose Eland, a novel framework that uses action sequence augmentation for early anomaly detection. Eland utilizes a sequence predictor to predict next actions of every user and exploits the mutual enhancement between action sequence augmentation and user-action graph anomaly detection. Experiments on three realworld datasets show that Eland improves the performance of a variety of graph-based anomaly detection methods. With Eland, anomaly detection performance at an earlier stage is better than non-augmented methods that need significantly more observed data by up to 15\% on the Area under the ROC curve.},

The volume and velocity of the data within many systems makes it difficult for typical algorithms to scale and retain their real-time characteristics. The pervasiveness of data combined with the problem that many existing algorithms only consider the content of the data source; e.g. a sensor reading itself without concern for its context, leaves room for potential improvement. The proposed work defines a contextual anomaly detection framework. It is composed of two distinct steps: content detection and context detection. The content detector is used to determine anomalies in real-time, while possibly, and likely, identifying false positives. The context detector is used to prune the output of the content detector, identifying those anomalies which are considered both content and contextually anomalous. The context detector utilizes the concept of profiles, which are groups of similarly grouped data points generated by a multivariate clustering algorithm. The research has been evaluated against two real-world sensor datasets provided by a local company in Brampton, Canada. Additionally, the framework has been evaluated against the open-source Dodgers dataset, available at the UCI machine learning repository, and against the R statistical toolbox.},

	abstract = {Attributed networks are ubiquitous and form a critical component of modern information infrastructure, where additional node attributes complement the raw network structure in knowledge discovery. Recently, detecting anomalous nodes on attributed networks has attracted an increasing amount of research attention, with broad applications in various high-impact domains, such as cybersecurity, ﬁnance, and healthcare. Most of the existing attempts, however, tackle the problem with shallow learning mechanisms by ego-network or community analysis, or through subspace selection. Undoubtedly, these models cannot fully address the computational challenges on attributed networks. For example, they often suﬀer from the network sparsity and data nonlinearity issues, and fail to capture the complex interactions between diﬀerent information modalities, thus negatively impact the performance of anomaly detection. To tackle the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we study the anomaly detection problem on attributed networks by developing a novel deep model. In particular, our proposed deep model: (1) explicitly models the topological structure and nodal attributes seamlessly for node embedding learning with the prevalent graph convolutional network (GCN); and (2) is customized to address the anomaly detection problem by virtue of deep autoencoder that leverages the learned embeddings to reconstruct the original data. The synergy between GCN and autoencoder enables us to spot anomalies by measuring the reconstruction errors of nodes from both the structure and the attribute perspectives. Extensive experiments on real-world attributed network datasets demonstrate the eﬃcacy of our proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {BankSim is an agent-based simulator of bank payments based on a sample of aggregated transactional data provided by a bank in Spain. The main purpose of BankSim is the generation of synthetic data that can be used for fraud detection research. Statistical and a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of relations between merchants and customers were used to develop and calibrate the model. Our ultimate goal is for BankSim to be usable to model relevant scenarios that combine normal payments and injected known fraud signatures. The data sets generated by BankSim contain no personal information or disclosure of legal and private customer transactions. Therefore, it can be shared by academia, and others, to develop and reason about fraud detection methods. Synthetic data has the added benefit of being easier to acquire, faster and at less cost, for experimentation even for those that have access to their own data. We argue that BankSim generates data that usefully approximates the relevant aspects of the real data. We intend to make the simulation and its results available to the research community.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02933},
	abstract = {Despite the growing popularity of 802.11 wireless networks, users often suffer from connectivity problems and performance issues due to unstable radio conditions and dynamic user behavior among other reasons. Anomaly detection and distinction are in the thick of major challenges that network managers encounter. Complication of monitoring the broaden and complex WLANs, that often requires heavy instrumentation of the user devices, makes the anomaly detection analysis even harder. In this paper we exploit 802.11 access point usage data and propose an anomaly detection technique based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Universal Background Model (UBM) on data that is inexpensive to obtain. We then generate a number of network anomalous scenarios in OMNeT++/INET network simulator and compare the detection outcomes with those in baseline approaches (RawData and PCA). The experimental results show the superiority of HMM and HMM-UBM models in detection precision and sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Social media has become an ideal platform for the propagation of rumors, fake news, and misinformation. Rumors on social media not only mislead online users but also affect the real world immensely. Thus, detecting the rumors and preventing their spread became an essential task. Some of the recent deep learning-based rumor detection methods, such as Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), represent rumor using the completed stage of the rumor diffusion and try to learn the structural information from it. However, these methods are limited to represent rumor propagation as a static graph, which isn’t optimal for capturing the dynamic information of the rumors. In this study, we propose novel graph convolutional networks with attention mechanisms, named Dynamic GCN, for rumor detection. We first represent rumor posts with their responsive posts as dynamic graphs. The temporal information is used to generate a sequence of graph snapshots. The representation learning on graph snapshots with attention mechanism captures both structural and temporal information of rumor spreads. The conducted experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dynamic GCN over the state-of-the-art methods in the rumor detection task.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)based approach for improving the diagnosis of neurological diseases using scalp-electroencephalograms (EEGs). Although EEG is one of the main tests used for neurological-disease diagnosis, the sensitivity of EEG-based expert visual diagnosis remains at ∼50\%. This indicates a clear need for advanced methodology to reduce the false negative rate in detecting abnormal scalp-EEGs. In that context, we focus on the problem of distinguishing the abnormal scalp EEGs of patients with neurological diseases, which were originally classiﬁed as ’normal’ by experts, from the scalp EEGs of healthy individuals. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: 1) we present EEG-GCNN, a novel GCNN model for EEG data that captures both the spatial and functional connectivity between the scalp electrodes, 2) using EEG-GCNN, we perform the ﬁrst large-scale evaluation of the aforementioned hypothesis, and 3) using two large scalp-EEG databases, we demonstrate that EEG-GCNN signiﬁcantly outperforms the human baseline and classical machine learning (ML) baselines, with an AUC of 0.90.},
