\begin{abstract}
Anomaly detection is becoming important in modern society as everything goes digital. Consumers are spending a lot more time online, and various digital sensors are placed into physical/chemical equipment for health monitoring. Such monitoring data is growing at an exponential rate, which enables automated anomaly detection in various high-impact domains. In this tutorial, we dive deep into several state-of-art methods for finding anomalies in spatiotemporal data (or more generally correlated multivariate data), on a few specific use cases such as telecom network performance and user behavior monitoring. We identify suitable methods for specific data representation (i.e. spatial, temporal and categorical dimensionality) under specific use case, with ways to convert raw data into the formats the existing methods assume. Such survey and hands-on exercise is necessary as each use case has its own special data representation and requirements in live applications. Certain methods fit better than others for a specific data format under a specific scenario. With such investigation outlined in this tutorial, we hope attendees will be able to more efficiently choose the most appropriate method for their use case. 

To reach as wide an audience as possible, we investigate anomaly detection application in multiple domains, which include Telecom network performance, user behavior monitoring, financial transactions, and industrial Internet of Things. These use cases are also the most commonly seen business problems among past customer engagements. The types of datasets range from univariate, multi-variate time sereis of single or multiple entities, to transactional tabular data with timestamps or sequenced indexes. The types of anomalies in these datasets include contextual anomalies for one entity or collective anomalies aggregated among multiple entities in time series, and suspicious record or user in transactional tabular data.

The specific use cases in telecom space we look into is about finding anomalies in the network performance data. On top of the large amount of sequential device KPI metrics and categorial error/fault alarms, the network topology is another important source of information that is helpful to investigate the correlations between devices. Because of the cost and sensitivity of sharing telecom network data, there is a general lack of public datasets in telecom space. A lot of the public data are often either only simulated within a small geographic context or presented in very coarse temporal interval (i.e. quarterly instead of hourly). The largest open source initiative we find is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) AI/ML in 5G challenge. For this hands-on tutorial, we look into a simulated Wi-Fi network dataset \cite{allahdadi_80211_2018} and another simulated wireless network data in 2021 Graph Neural Networking Challenge \cite{suarez-varela_graph_2021}. Both datasets are simulated using OMNeT++, and the objective is to find anomalies in quality of service (QoS) quantified by amount of packets dropped or packets delay. 

With the growing popularity of online shopping, consumers now tend to rely more on crowd-sourced information rather than their own impressions, such as user reviews on Google and Amazon. This has encouraged malicious promotion scams through fake and compromised accounts. User behavior anomaly detection in our tutorial aims to introduce solutions on identification of suspicious behavior given a user’s past activities or other normal users' behavior patterns. We use the Pushshift Reddit dataset \cite{baumgartner_pushshift_2020} for demonstration. It is a real-world social media dataset that has monthly comment threads starting from 2005 up to 2021. The objective is to detect anomalous user and comment. As there is no groundtruth anomalous labels in the original dataset, we apply similar tricks to generate partial labels following previous studies \cite{liu_anomaly_2015, zhao_action_2021}. 

Fraud detection in financial services refers to a set of technologies employed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. Frauds are considered rare events but they lead to significant financial impact to organizations and their customers. For this hands-on tutorial, we explore a simulated transactional dataset with timesteps called BankSim \cite{lopez-rojas_banksim_2014}. BankSim is an agent-based simulator of bank payments based on a sample of aggregated transactional data provided by a bank in Spain.  Statistical and Social Network Analysis (SNA) of relations between merchants and customers were used to model scenarios combining normal payments and injected known fraud signatures.  BankSim was run for 180 steps (approximately six months), several times and parameters were calibrated to obtain a distribution close enough for reliable testing. Thieves were injected, aiming to steal an average of three cards per step and perform about two fraudulent transactions per day. The objective of this use case is to detect these thieves and fraudulent transactions.  

Anomalies in the industrial monitoring domain often involves a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) which is comprised of interconnected devices and sensors. The anomalies are often contextual, meaning anomalous readings is only apparent when comparing through context, often time or other sensors. We will explore the BATADAL dataset \cite{taormina18battle} in this tutorial for this use case. The BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL) data set is from a real-world, medium-sized water distribution system operated through programmable logic controllers and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The data contains simulated SCADA observations with anomalies at the sensor level that mimics real world attacks on water management systems. It consists of multiple time series containing sensor values of 43 system variables, with each time step labeled as attack or normal operation. The objective is to identify the attacks/anomalies at the timestep level.  

The available choices of anomaly detection modeling framework ranges from sequential or time series models \cite{lavin_evaluating_2015, cui_comparative_2016, ahmad_unsupervised_2017, allahdadi_80211_2018, carmona_neural_2021}, to static graph neural network models \cite{martin_happ_graph-neural-network-based_2021, wu_graph_2021, deng_graph_2021, wu_graph_2022} and dynamic graph neural network models \cite{liu_anomaly_2015, zheng_addgraph_2019, zhao_action_2021, choi_dynamic_2021} that learns coupled spatial, structural and temporal information. Among these models, anomaly detection is formulated as a forecast problem for some use cases \cite{ahmad_unsupervised_2017, deng_graph_2021}, in which anomaly severity is derived based on the observed value deviation from the predicted value. In other use cases, anomaly detection is solved as a classification problem \cite{liu_anomaly_2015, allahdadi_80211_2018, zhao_action_2021} (either as node, edge classification in graph,  row-based classification in tabular data or sequential classification in sequence data). During a three-hour hands-on tutorial, we examine the suitability and performance of different methods for the 4 introduced use cases. Given the time limit, we will focus on the time series based HTM method introduced in \cite{ahmad_unsupervised_2017, carmona_neural_2021} and graph methods introduced in \cite{liu_anomaly_2015, deng_graph_2021, zhao_action_2021}. The tutorial combines an introduction of fundamental anomaly detection techniques with hands-on exercises in which participants identify suitable methods, apply data transformation techniques to convert raw data into the formats the different methods assume, and study these methods on the aforementioned real-world or synthetic data sets.

% \section{Introduction}
% ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
% consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and
% incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
% necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
% SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique
% features incorporated into this single new template.

% If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable
% guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you
% have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
% instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
% for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage
% of publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the
% author's own version, with {\itshape very} few changes to the source.

% \section{Template Overview}
% As noted in the introduction, the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can
% be used to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a
% double-blind initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
% two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a ``camera-ready''
% journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by
% selecting the appropriate {\itshape template style} and {\itshape
%   template parameters}.

% This document will explain the major features of the document
% class. For further information, the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide} is
% available from
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}.

% \subsection{Template Styles}

% The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is
% the {\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication
% or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square
% brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
% use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|acmsmall|}: The default journal template style.
% \item {\verb|acmlarge|}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
% \item {\verb|acmtog|}: Used by TOG.
% \end{itemize}

% The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|acmconf|}: The default proceedings template style.
% \item{\verb|sigchi|}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
% \item{\verb|sigchi-a|}: Used for SIGCHI ``Extended Abstract'' articles.
% \item{\verb|sigplan|}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Template Parameters}

% In addition to specifying the {\itshape template style} to be used in
% formatting your work, there are a number of {\itshape template parameters}
% which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list
% of these parameters can be found in the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

% Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|anonymous,review|}: Suitable for a ``double-blind''
%   conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line
%   numbers. Use with the \verb|\acmSubmissionID| command to print the
%   submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
% \item{\verb|authorversion|}: Produces a version of the work suitable
%   for posting by the author.
% \item{\verb|screen|}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
% \end{itemize}

% This document uses the following string as the first command in the
% source file:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[sigconf,authordraft]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Modifications}

% Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
% margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
% and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
% vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

% {\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
%   modifications are discovered.}

% \section{Typefaces}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
% ``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
% this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
% ``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
% as they will override the built-in typeface families.

% \section{Title Information}

% The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
% \url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
% capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
% your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
% {\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

% If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
% in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
% command has a ``short title'' parameter:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \title[short title]{full title}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Authors and Affiliations}

% Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
% identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors'
% names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever
% possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.

% Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
% alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
%   \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
%   \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
% \end{verbatim}

% The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
% to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
% of an article contributed equally to the work.

% If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
% the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
% overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
% the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
% \end{verbatim}
% Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
% of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
% page headers.

% The article template's documentation, available at
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
% complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
% use.

% Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

% \section{Rights Information}

% Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
% form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
% made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
% license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

% Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
% copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
% form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
% document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
% their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
% document:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
% \item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
% \item the conference information in the page header(s).
% \end{itemize}

% Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
% works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
% each of the works.

% The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
% page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

% \section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

% Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
% taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
% search.

% The ACM Computing Classification System ---
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
% classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
% discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
% system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
% commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

% User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
% of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
% the research being presented.

% CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
% articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
% two-page articles (or abstracts).

% \section{Sectioning Commands}

% Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
% \verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
% \verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
% from the commands.

% Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
% a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

% \section{Tables}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
% package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
% high-quality tables.

% Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
% them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
% table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
% \textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
% columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
% detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
% \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
% placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
% this document.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%   \label{tab:freq}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
%     $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%     \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%     $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%   \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
% live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
% contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
% wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
% desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
% in the printed output of this document.

% \begin{table*}
%   \caption{Some Typical Commands}
%   \label{tab:commands}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Command &A Number & Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table*}

% Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
% use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
% recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
% more easily.

% \section{Math Equations}
% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
% discussed in the next sections.

% \subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
% in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
% which can be invoked with the usual
% \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
% the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
% and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
% examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
% \begin{math}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).

% \subsection{Display Equations}
% A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
% text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
% environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
% \textbf{displaymath} environment.

% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
% structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
% of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
% equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
% \begin{displaymath}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
% \end{displaymath}
% and follow it with another numbered equation:
% \begin{equation}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
% \end{equation}
% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

% \section{Figures}

% The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
% more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
% third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
% in the example below.
% \begin{figure}[h]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
%   \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
%     Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
%     Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
%   \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
% \end{figure}

% Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
% the reader.

% Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

% Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
% decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
% who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
% indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

% A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
% characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
%   should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
%   important information that is not already provided in the caption or
%   the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
% complex new information, a short text description may not be
% adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
% appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
% provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
% structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
% regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
% so important, please see
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

% \subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

% A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
% are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
% the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
% figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
% \verb|\maketitle| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{teaserfigure}
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
%     \caption{figure caption}
%     \Description{figure description}
%   \end{teaserfigure}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Citations and Bibliographies}

% The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
% references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
% --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
% (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
% reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
% article DOI, etc.

% The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
% commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{bibfile}
% \end{verbatim}
% where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
% suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

% Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
% ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
% ``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
% command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
% ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
% \end{verbatim}

%   Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%   enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%   issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%   monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%   \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%   \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
%   the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
%   Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
%   a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
%   divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
%   book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
%   conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings
%   article) \cite{Andler79, Hagerup1993}, a proceedings article with
%   all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
%   proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
%   \cite{Harel78}, a couple of preprints \cite{Bornmann2019,
%     AnzarootPBM14}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a
%   master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
%   resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game
%   (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05}
%   and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
%   publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
%   \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
%   contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
%   \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
%   multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
%   couple of citations with DOIs:
%   \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online
%   citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}. Artifacts:
%   \cite{R} and \cite{UMassCitations}.

% \section{Acknowledgments}

% Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
% individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
% preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
% section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
% document.

% This section has a special environment:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{acks}
%   ...
%   \end{acks}
% \end{verbatim}
% so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
% during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
% consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

% Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

% \section{Appendices}

% If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
% ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
% document.

% Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \appendix
% \end{verbatim}
% and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
% numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
% and subsection identification method.

% \section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

% The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
% not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
% a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
% ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
% the margin:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|sidebar|}:  Place formatted text in the margin.
% \item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.
% \item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
% \end{itemize}

% %%
% %% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
% %% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
% %% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
% %% consistent spelling of the heading.
% \begin{acks}
% To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
% \end{acks}

%%
%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{kdd_tutorial}
