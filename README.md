# KDD 2022 Hands-on Tutorial: Anomaly Detection For Spatial Temporal Data

## Overview
This github repo is prepared for KDD 2022 hands-on tutorial. The project pipelines are prepared using the templates from Kedro 0.18.0. 


## Setting up the environment

We declared dependencies for different pipelines for different use cases and prepared shell script to install the virtual environment. Once the virtual environment is installed, you can run the notebook using the customized env/kernel. Also, user can run the corresponding pipeline after activating the virtual env. 
For example, to run the financial fraud detection pipeline using the TADDY(dynamic graph based) modeling framework, follow these steps below: 
1. Prepare the Kedro Taddy virtual environment 
Run the following command:

2. Activate the virtual environment
Run the following command:

4. Run the pipeline 
Note that kedro pipeline has to be initiated from the repo root directory. So run the following command:
